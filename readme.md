# Proxy Server Project

## Overview
This project implements a **Proxy Server** designed to handle client requests and forward them to the intended remote server. The primary objective of this application is to provide an intermediary server that facilitates secure communication and data exchange using SSL/TLS protocols.

## Features
- **SSL/TLS Support:** Secure communication between the proxy, client, and remote server.
- **Request Forwarding:** Forward HTTP/HTTPS requests and return responses without modifying data.
- **Multi-threading:** Efficient handling of multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **Logging:** Track requests, connections, and errors with detailed logs.
- **Configuration Management:** Customize server settings through configuration files.
- **UI:** A basic UI that help peole control and config easily.

## Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows (x64)
- **Dependencies:**
  - OpenSSL
  - GCC compiler (MinGW from MSYS2 recommended)
  - Inno Setup (for packaging the application)

## Installation
1. Download the installer from the `Output` directory or the provided link.
2. Run the installer `ProxyServerSetup.exe`.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Usage
1. Launch the application by running `demo.exe`.
2. Configure the server settings using files in the `CONFIG` directory if needed.
3. Monitor logs to track ERRORS (for development).

## Development
### Building the Project
1. Install MinGW (or a compatible GCC compiler).
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the executable:
   ```bash
   make build    # Build project
   make run      # Run code
   ```

### Creating the Installer
1. Install Inno Setup.
2. Use the provided `ProxyServerSetup.iss` file to generate the installer:
   ```
   Open Inno Setup > Load ProxyServerSetup.iss > Compile
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- **Icons Not Displayed in Shortcuts:** Ensure the `.ico` file is in the correct directory and specified in the installer script.
- **SSL Errors:** Verify that the certificate files in the `CERTIFICATE` directory are valid and correctly configured.
- **Connection Issues:** Check firewall or network settings that may block the proxy server.
